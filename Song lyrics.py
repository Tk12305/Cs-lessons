    \n[Mike Shinoda:]
    \nForfeit the game
    \nBefore somebody else
    \nTakes you outta the frame
    \nAnd puts your name to shame
    \nCover up your face
    \nYou can't run the race
    \nThe pace is too fast
    \nYou just won't last

    \n[Chester Bennington:]
    \nYou love the way I look at you
    \nWhile taking pleasure in the awful things you put me through
    \nYou take away if I give in
    \nMy life
    \nMy pride is broken
    \nYou like to think you're never wrong
    \n(You live what you've learned)
    \nYou have to act like you're someone
    \n(You live what you've learned)
    \nYou want someone to hurt like you
    \n(You live what you've learned)
    \nYou want to share what you've been through
    \n(You live what you've learned)

    \nYou love the things I say I'll do
    \nThe way I hurt myself again just to get back at you
    \nYou take away when I give in
    \nMy life
    \nMy pride is broken

    \nYou like to think you're never wrong
    \n(You live what you've learned)
    \nYou have to act like you're someone
    \n(You live what you've learned)
    \nYou want someone to hurt like you
    \n(You live what you've learned)
    \nYou want to share what you've been through
    \n(You live what you've learned)
